title: Call for submissions — Marsh anthology stories
---

One of the stretch goals for [the *Marsh* Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drabmakyo/marsh) is to fund additional short stories surrounding the events of [*Marsh*](https://marsh.post-self.ink) written by authors interested in the Post-Self setting. These stories will be included alongside *Marsh* — or in a separate volume, depending on the response — published in a separate volume.

To that end, I am soliciting stories surrounding the sudden downtime and disappearance of cladists across Lagrange on New Year's Eve, 2399.

### The Details

Word count
:   Approximately 2,000–5,000 (please ask if you are planning on writing more; I will likely say yes!)

Payment
:   Flat fee of $50 and a copy of the book if accepted for print. All stories, regardless of whether they are accepted, are eligible to be included on the site as canon so long as everyone agrees.

Submission format
:   MS Word, LibreOffice, or Google Docs — basically, anything I can comment on. If you want to submit LaTeX or Markdown, good on ya~
