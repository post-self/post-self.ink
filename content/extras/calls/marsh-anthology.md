title: Call for submissions — Marsh anthology stories
---

One of the stretch goals for [the *Marsh* Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drabmakyo/marsh) is to fund additional short stories surrounding the events of [*Marsh*](https://marsh.post-self.ink) written by authors interested in the Post-Self setting. These stories will be included alongside *Marsh* or in a separate volume, depending on the response.

To that end, I am soliciting stories surrounding the sudden downtime and disappearance of cladists across Lagrange on New Year's Eve, 2399.

### The Details

Word count
:   Approximately 2,000–5,000 (please ask if you are planning on writing more; I will likely say yes!)

Payment
:   Flat fee of $50+[^1] and a copy of the book if accepted for print. All stories, regardless of whether they are accepted, are eligible to be included on the site as canon so long as everyone agrees.

Submission format
:   MS Word, LibreOffice, or Google Docs — basically, anything I can comment on. If you want to submit LaTeX or Markdown, good on ya~

Submission Deadline
:   Soft deadline: April 30, 2024 / Hard deadline: May 31, 2024

Estimated publication date
:   August 1, 2024

Please include
:   Your story and a short author bio

Please read
:   The [What is Post-Self?](https://wiki.post-self.ink/wiki/What_is_Post-Self%3F) page, the [writing guide](https://wiki.post-self.ink/wiki/Writing_guide), and at least [the synopsis of *Marsh*](https://wiki.post-self.ink/wiki/Marsh/synopsis). I will also provide the current draft of the book if you get in touch.

Consider joining
:   Either [Discord](https://makyo.io/ps-discord) or the Post-Self [Telegram Group](https://makyo.io/ps-telegram).

Submit by

### Collaboration

This is a collaborative anthology, following the pattern established by [The Furry Historical Fiction Society](https://fhfs.ink) and [*Clade*](https://clade.post-self.ink). As such, much of the discussion around the project will take place on Telegram and Discord, and organization will take place via Google Sheets. In the latter case, we are happy to help manage your information in the sheet if you do not have a Google account, but communication via one of the two chat outlets is required.

The general outline of steps is as follows:

1. Application and description — you will pick a topic for your story and fill in your information on the sheet.
2. Writing — write your draft, keeping the other writers up to date on your progress via the chat and the sheet.
3. Editing and reading — edit your story, ask for beta reads, get an editing pass from others, and so on.
4. Typesetting — an order for the stories will be chosen and they will be typeset into a PDF for the paperback.
5. Round-robin editing — once all stories are typeset, you will help do line- and copy-editing for the stories before and after your own on the final print PDF.
6. Publication and marketing — help boost the visibility of the anthology on your socials!

More information is available on request, and you can always feel free to ask questions of Madison.
