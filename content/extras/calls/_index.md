title: Calls for Submissions
---

Here are the open calls for submissions in the Post-Self setting. All are open for both written and visual work — though if you are interested in incidental music or video submissions, we can make that work~ We all keep up on [Discord](https://makyo.io/ps-discord) and [Telegram](https://makyo.io/ps-telegram), feel free to join!

## [The *Marsh* anthology](marsh-anthology)

One of the stretch goals for [the *Marsh* Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drabmakyo/marsh) is to fund additional short stories surrounding the events of [*Marsh*](https://marsh.post-self.ink) written by authors interested in the Post-Self setting. These stories will be included alongside *Marsh* or in a separate volume, depending on the response.

To that end, I am soliciting stories surrounding the sudden downtime and disappearance of cladists across Lagrange on New Year's Eve, 2399.

(2,000–5,000 words; $50+ flat fee, plus a copy of the book)

## [*Ask. — An Odist Q&A*](ask)

The response to the *Marsh* Kickstarter has been lovely, and so much has already been accomplished. One of the stretch goals that was reached was for an anthology of short fiction taking the form of a Q&A with [members of the Ode clade](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/156SolB7hXWsr-IlwqTwbnlLHJI1hwBpC_Q0G6dTA1xo/edit?usp=sharing) (non-spoiler version [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/156SolB7hXWsr-IlwqTwbnlLHJI1hwBpC_Q0G6dTA1xo/edit?usp=sharing)) past and present. These answers will be written by the Post-Self community over on Discord (feel free to [join](https://makyo.io/ps-discord), either to contribute or just chat with cool folks), several of whom have Odists parked in their heads. These will be collected into an anthology to be made available alongside *Marsh* itself.

Consider this, then, a **Call for Submissions** of questions for post-human skunks (and fennecs and panthers and...)! [The ask box is open](https://cohost.org/post-self/ask), and if you would like to see a sample of what we have so far,  you can check out the [IC Asks](https://post-self.ink/extras/ic-asks) that have already been answered.

(100–5,000 words; a copy of the book)

## [As yet untitled kink anthology](kink-anthology)

What avenues does life sys-side open up for exploring kink? What does forking get you? How about endless memory? Sensorium messages? What new kinks form and what other kinks fade away?

We are looking to pull together a collection of short stories exploring specifically the ways in which kink changes after uploading one's consciousness. While kink often includes or is intertwined with sex, your story need not include any sex — and conversely, this is not simply an anthology of erotica, but an exploration of kink. Here is a chance to pull apart a kink, discover what makes it tick, and then put it together in this lovely setting where even the concept of self is challenged.

(2,000–10,000 words; TBD flat fee pending funding, plus a copy of the book)

## [As yet untitled Arthurian legend anthology](arthur)

Lagrange — a half-kilometer cylinder of computronium idling out near the moon. Aboard are only uploaded minds, each able to fork, creating copies of themselves at will, and merge back down to share their separate memories. Of these personalities, we find ourselves with countless stories, and among those stories, echoes of the past appear, all surrounding a group of friends. The legends of King Arthur play out once more.
