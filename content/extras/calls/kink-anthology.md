title: Call for submissions — Kink in the Post-Self Setting
type: page
---

What avenues does life sys-side open up for exploring kink? What does forking get you? How about endless memory? Sensorium messages? What new kinks form and what other kinks fade away?

We are looking to pull together a collection of short stories exploring specifically the ways in which kink changes after uploading one's consciousness. While kink often includes or is intertwined with sex, your story need not include any sex — and conversely, this is not simply an anthology of erotica, but an exploration of kink. Here is a chance to pull apart a kink, discover what makes it tick, and then put it together in this lovely setting where even the concept of self is challenged.

    * If you have read at [*Toledot*](https://toledot.post-self.ink) or do not mind spoilers, ["Shared Moment"](/stories/shared-moment) for some explorations of sexuality's intersection with those mechanics

### Collaboration

This is a collaborative anthology, following the pattern established by [The Furry Historical Fiction Society](https://fhfs.ink) and [*Clade*](https://clade.post-self.ink). As such, much of the discussion around the project will take place on Telegram and Discord, and organization will take place via Google Sheets. In the latter case, we are happy to help manage your information in the sheet if you do not have a Google account, but communication via one of the two chat outlets is required.

The general outline of steps is as follows:

1. Application and description — you will pick a topic for your story and fill in your information on the sheet.
2. Writing — write your draft, keeping the other writers up to date on your progress via the chat and the sheet.
3. Editing and reading — edit your story, ask for beta reads, get an editing pass from others, and so on.
4. Typesetting — an order for the stories will be chosen and they will be typeset into a PDF for the paperback.
5. Round-robin editing — once all stories are typeset, you will help do line- and copy-editing for the stories before and after your own on the final print PDF.
6. Publication and marketing — help boost the visibility of the anthology on your socials!

More information is available on request, and you can always feel free to ask questions of Madison.
