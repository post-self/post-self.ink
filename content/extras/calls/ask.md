title: "Call for submissions: Ask. — An Odist Q&A"
---

The response to the *Marsh* Kickstarter has been lovely, and so much has already been accomplished. One of the stretch goals that was reached was for an anthology of short fiction taking the form of a Q&A with [members of the Ode clade](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/156SolB7hXWsr-IlwqTwbnlLHJI1hwBpC_Q0G6dTA1xo/edit?usp=sharing) (non-spoiler version [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/156SolB7hXWsr-IlwqTwbnlLHJI1hwBpC_Q0G6dTA1xo/edit?usp=sharing)) past and present. These answers will be written by the Post-Self community over on Discord (feel free to [join](https://makyo.io/ps-discord), either to contribute or just chat with cool folks), several of whom have Odists parked in their heads. These will be collected into an anthology to be made available alongside *Marsh* itself.

Consider this, then, a **Call for Submissions** of questions for post-human skunks (and fennecs and panthers and...)! [The ask box is open](https://cohost.org/post-self/ask), and if you would like to see a sample of what we have so far,  you can check out the [IC Asks](https://post-self.ink/extras/ic-asks) that have already been answered. 

*Edit:*  is a spoiler-free list of the Odists and their specialties.

If you would like to *answer* a question, keep reading below!

### Collaboration

This is a collaborative anthology, following the pattern established by [The Furry Historical Fiction Society](https://fhfs.ink) and [*Clade*](https://clade.post-self.ink). As such, much of the discussion around the project will take place on Telegram and Discord, and organization will take place via Google Sheets. In the latter case, we are happy to help manage your information in the sheet if you do not have a Google account, but communication via one of the two chat outlets is required.

The general outline of steps is as follows:

1. Application and description — you will pick a topic for your story and fill in your information on the sheet.
2. Writing — write your draft, keeping the other writers up to date on your progress via the chat and the sheet.
3. Editing and reading — edit your story, ask for beta reads, get an editing pass from others, and so on.
4. Typesetting — an order for the stories will be chosen and they will be typeset into a PDF for the paperback.
5. Round-robin editing — once all stories are typeset, you will help do line- and copy-editing for the stories before and after your own on the final print PDF.
6. Publication and marketing — help boost the visibility of the anthology on your socials!

More information is available on request, and you can always feel free to ask questions of Madison.
