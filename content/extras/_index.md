### Other, sillier things

* ["How to Upload Your Consciousness to Physical Infrastructure Using Docker Compose"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-upload-your-consciousness-to-physical-infrastructure-using-docker-compose) (Non-canonical but heavily influenced 'tutorial' written for April Fool's Day 2022)
* [In-Character asks](ic-asks) — Questions asked of various Post-Self characters, answered by the characters themselves. Authors include [@makyo](https://cohost.org/makyo), [@hamratza](https://cohost.org/hamratza), and [@CERESUltra](https://cohost.org/CERESUltra).

## Soundtracks

Each book within the Post-Self Cycle, as well as many of the other stories in the setting, was written with a song or playlist running on repeat — at least for the most part. Just a little something that helped the author set the mood. While these are hardly required to enjoy the writing, they're offered as a curiosity.
