Nanon is the common language spoken by the four races aboard Artemis. Originally secondrace's language, it has become the *lingua franca* amongst all Artemisians â€” and, after convergence, all humans who joined Artemis in its ongoing journey. It is an artificial language originally created in 2002 by Madison Scott-Clary as a way to alleviate the boredom of a Latin class. For a while, all digital copies were lost, with one [hard copy and notes](http://nanon.lang.drab-makyo.com/old/Nanon.pdf) remaining in a binder on her bookshelf. Now, sixteen years later, the docs have been scanned and the language is being typed up again. Due to being younger and dumber, the tone and quality is...not great, but the information is provided nearly in full to anyone interested.
