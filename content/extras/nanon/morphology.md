Words are constructed from roots with affixes.

## Nouns

The root form of a word defaults to being a noun. For example, *mabåt* means 'a walk'. Nouns can be inflected via a few affixes:

* **es-** - plural prefix
* **ach-** - optional masculine prefix
* **ech-** - optional feminine prefix
* **uch-** - optional epicene prefix
* **-en** - genitive suffix
* **-am** - accusative suffix

## Verbs

Verbs append the suffix **-i** to come up with a reasonable related word. For example, *mabåti* means to walk. Verbs can be inflected via a few affixes:

* **-er** - transitive suffix
* **-a** - imperative suffix

## Adjectives and adverbs

## Modifiers

> Modifiers don't really have any exact English equivalents, as they don't particularly mean anything, but they modify what a word, phrase, or sentence means. An example would be the tense words *ze* for past, *zo* for present (often implied), and *za* for future. These particular words have a suffix to go along with them that makes them perfect: **-n** (...)
>
> The -n suffix mentioned above, however, only goes with the tense modifiers, and not any others. In fact, there are only three global affixes, all prefixes (all of the suffixes act locally, as with **-n**), which change what the modifier modifies: **un-** for the word, **in-** for the phrase, or **en-** for the entire sentence.
