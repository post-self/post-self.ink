> What's an Odist and what's a sim?

Serene; Sustained And Sustaining

    An Odist is a member of the Ode clade. We are (nominally) 100 individuals descended from a single uploaded consciousness named Michelle Hadje. As Michelle is no longer extant, this had led to us being ten disconnected subclades. Each of us is named from a line in a poem Many of us are human, many of us are anthropomorphic skunks — Michelle was a furry, back on Earth — and two of us are fennec foxes, for better or worse.

    Sims are the locations in which we live. I happen to be a sim designer, with a specialization in natural settings rather than buildings.
