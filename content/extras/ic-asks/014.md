May Then My Name Die With Me
:   ([@makyo](https://cohost.org/makyo))

    There is a moment at the very beginning of every relationship when their eyes light up on seeing me, and I can sense the gears finally mesh within their minds and they think, "Holy shit, I think I am in love."

    I am not immune to this, to be clear. I will be getting closer to someone and they will be doing the most innocuous thing — with Ioan, it was em changing the ink in one of eir fountain pens, leaning down with eir eyes almost level with the desk, the tip of eir tongue peeking out from between eir teeth — and I will think, "Oh gosh...I love them, do I not? I really do."

    I am sure that we all have our own answers, but for me, it is that moment. That is the most beautiful thing that I have seen.
