> Bit of an odd question, is it possible for an down-tree or root member of a clade to merge with an up-tree cocladist? Essentially, willingly subsuming themselves into an up-tree member of their clade?

    *Yes. Sort of. We call this 'bubbling up', which is when an individuated fork merges down and then the down-tree instance assumes their identity. The issue, however, is that when merging, the down-tree instance has the ability to selectively merge memories, while they cannot release their own memories, **except** in the instance where there are conflicting memories, wherein one can choose the up-tree instance's memories â€” this usually means a reinforcement to the point where the down-tree instance's memories in those cases feel more like a whimsical imagining rather than quite real.*
