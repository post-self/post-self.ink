Serene; Sustained And Sustaining
:   ([@makyo](https://cohost.org/makyo))

    I spent six months as an oak standing beside a river. My roots ran deep and I drank of fresh, cool water. My boughs reached high and I felt that striving for the sun. My wood was strong, my bark was thick, my heart was alive and green with sap.

    It was also incredibly fucking boring.
