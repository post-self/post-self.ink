There is one piece of music written for the Post-Self setting (so far!): ["Getting Lost"](/getting-lost.mp3) is a piece tied to the "RJ getting lost" scene in *Qoheleth*.

However, there is also a lot of music that is *associated* with the works and characters in the universe. These playlists are provided as TuneMyMusic links, which will allow you to open them in most common streaming services.

## Canon

Each book within the Post-Self Cycle, as well as many of the other stories in the setting, was written with a song or playlist running on repeat â€” at least for the most part. Just a little something that helped the author set the mood. While these are hardly required to enjoy the writing, they're offered for completion's sake.

## Characters

Character playlists are offered both to give a sense of the characters' moods when writing, but also, as many are constructed by fictive headmates, they give a sense of how the headmates fit into the system. Note that the pages are generated via an export tool, so the playlists themselves on Spotify may differ, because it is a pain in the ass to update them.
