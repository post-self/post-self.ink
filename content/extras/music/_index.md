## Canon

Each book within the Post-Self Cycle, as well as many of the other stories in the setting, was written with a song or playlist running on repeat — at least for the most part. Just a little something that helped the author set the mood. While these are hardly required to enjoy the writing, they're offered for completion's sake.

## Characters

Character playlists are offered both to give a sense of the characters' moods when writing, but also, as many are constructed by fictive headmates, they give a sense of how the headmates fit into the system. Note that the pages are generated via an export tool, so the playlists themselves on Spotify may differ.
