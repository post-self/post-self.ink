        <p>From the very beginning of the consensual dream of the System, the members of the Ode clade, all forks from the same core personality, have dealt with fear each in their own way.

        <p>From roots in political turmoil to the building of a new society, the story is there to be found, and the Bălan clade is there to tell it.</p>

All of the information on working with the universe is contained within this appendix, an extra funded by the *Mitzvot* Kickstarter backers.
