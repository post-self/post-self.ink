                <li>Given the chance to live forever in a world not built for death, what do you do?</li>
                <li>Given the inability to forget—all your joys and sorrows, all your foundational memories and traumas—how do you cope?</li>
                <li>Given the ability to create a full copy of yourself—down to every single one of those memories—to do as they will, to individuate and live out their own forever lives, or merge back down and meld their memories with your own, what paths do you take?</li>

        <p>The Post-Self universe is an open setting for exploring the ramifications of being able to create copies of oneself, of what it means to undergo individuation, of what it means to let memories build up and up and up within oneself. With four novels, two novellas, and an anthology of short stories, there's story to explore spanning nearly three centuries of history.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>And thus grew a new world, a world that was not built for death&hellip;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>From the very beginning of the consensual dream of the System, the members of the Ode clade, all forks from the same core personality, have dealt with fear each in their own way. Do they search for greater ways to control their lives? Do they hunt for yet deeper emotional connection? Do they hone their art to the finest point?</p>
        <p>From roots in political turmoil to the building of a new society, the story is there to be found, and the Bălan clade is there to tell it.</p>

        <p>To split oneself among however many individuals, to let the mind drift and diverge, to feel the world from points of view not your own, and then let those memories crash down into you…well, it inspires a feeling best described as ‘heady’, to say the least.</p>
