## The Post-Self Cycle

[![The book covers](/img/covers.png)](/cycle)

> And thus grew a new world, a world that was not built for death...

From the very beginning of the consensual dream of the System, the members of the Ode clade, all forks from the same core personality, have dealt with fear each in their own way. Do they search for greater ways to control their lives? Do they hunt for yet deeper emotional connection? Do they hone their art to the finest point?

From roots in political turmoil to the building of a new society, the story is there to be found, and the Bălan clade is there to tell it.

To split oneself among however many individuals, to let the mind drift and diverge, to feel the world from points of view not your own, and then let those memories crash down into you&hellip;well, it inspires a feeling best described as &lsquo;heady&rsquo;, to say the least.

*Coming August 1, 2023*
