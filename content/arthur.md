title: 'Call for submissions: Arthurian anthology'
---

Launch. In 2325, two smaller versions of the Lagrange System, Castor and Pollux, were launched in opposite directions on a one-way trip out of the Solar System. Aboard are only uploaded minds, each able to fork, creating copies of themselves at will, and merge back down to share their separate memories.

Of these personalities, we find ourselves with countless stories, and among those stories, echoes of the past appear, all surrounding a group of friends. The legends of King Arthur play out once more.

## Requirements

* 2,000--10,000 words
* Must be set in the Post-Self universe after 2325
* Must follow one of the Arthurian legends from the Matter of Britain, *The Once and Future King*, and so on
* This is an *aggressively* queer setting. While your story/characters don't need to be, any sentiment that goes against that will not be tolerated.
* Rather than submitting a story, you will apply to take part in the collaboration.

### Arthurian legends

The following legends have been claimed

* "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" — Madison Scott-Clary
* "The Questing Beast" — J.S. Hawthorne
* "Morgan le Fey" — Rob MacWolf
* "Tristan and Iseult" — Faux
* "The Sword Excalibur" — Michael Miele

As more legends are claimed via applications, they will be added to this list. If any are relinquished by the author, the list will be updated to reflect that.

More information on how the legends fit within the Post-Self universe will be available soon, so feel free to join the Telegram or Discord chats to learn more, even if you do not decide to write for the anthology.

### Collaboration

This is a collaborative anthology, following the pattern established by [The Furry Historical Fiction Society](https://fhfs.ink) and [*Clade*](https://clade.post-self.ink). As such, much of the discussion around the project will take place on Telegram and Discord, and organization will take place via Google Sheets. In the latter case, we are happy to help manage your information in the sheet if you do not have a Google account, but communication via one of the two chat outlets is required.

The general outline of steps is as follows:

1. Application and legend selection — you will select a story from the various legends of Arthur that no one else has selected (or discuss collaborating directly with another author) and fill in your information on the sheet.
2. Writing — write your draft, keeping the other writers up to date on your progress via the chat and the sheet.
3. Editing and reading — edit your story, ask for beta reads, get an editing pass from others, and so on.
4. Typesetting — an order for the stories will be chosen and they will be typeset into a PDF for the paperback.
5. Round-robin editing — once all stories are typeset, you will help do line- and copy-editing for the stories before and after your own on the final print PDF.
6. Publication and marketing — help boost the visibility of the anthology on your socials!

More information is available on request, and you can always feel free to ask questions of Madison.
