The timeline of the Post-Self cycle spans just over two and a half centuries, encompassing both the creation of the upload system and the arrival of the Artemisians on the Castor launch vehicle and partial dissolution of the Ode clade. The cycle tells only a portion of the history of the System, a microcosm of a world full of billions.
