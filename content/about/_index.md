> "All artists search. I search for stories, in this post-self age. What happens when you can no longer call yourself an individual, when you have split your sense of self among several instances? How do you react? Do you withdraw into yourself, become a hermit? Do you expand until you lose all sense of identity? Do you fragment? Do you go about it deliberately, or do you let nature and chance take their course?"

The Post-Self universe is an open setting for exploring the ramifications of being able to create copies of oneself, of what it means to undergo individuation, of what it means to let memories build up and up and up within oneself. All of the information on working with the universe is contained within the [Post-Self Wiki](https://wiki.post-self.ink). Here are some good places to start:

* [What is Post-Self?](https://wiki.post-self.ink/wiki/What_is_Post-Self%3F)
* [Writing in the Post-Self Setting](https://wiki.post-self.ink/wiki/Writing_guide)
* [Glossary](https://wiki.post-self.ink/wiki/Glossary)

The Wiki contains many spoilers. If you are interested in more information in a spoiler-free/spoiler-obscured format, the following pages are provided:

* [Dramatis Personae](characters)
