title: Writing in the Post-Self Universe
---

* The Lost
    * Each subjective experience is unique
    * There are permanent effects
        * Language
    * All of those who didn't die uploaded
* The System
    * The key mechanics
    * A collection of varied societies
* The Launch
    * Three Systems
    * Transmission delay
* Artemis
    * Four new races, one new System
    * Convergence — the event and the location

* 'Do's:
    * *Queerness:* The Post-Self setting is aggressively and explicitly queer. This is a place to explore identity through romance — monogamous and polyamorous — gender, species, plurality, anything. If it can be queered, please queer it! The society is far, far more accepting of such than today's, even phys-side.
    * *Neurodivergence:* As neurodivergence follows one along after uploading, this is an area ripe for exploration, whether that means finding ways to fork it away or finding ways to revel in it as an integral part of oneself.
    * *Climate crisis:* One big draw to the System is getting away from the worsening climate back on Earth. Even after it starts to level out (and even improve) after about 2350, the System offers greener grass. There are many stories to be told there.
    * *The bittersweet:* Uploading is one-way and destructive. There is a loss behind every upload. The System itself is built on the backs of the lost. Climate grief remains a real issue. Finding ways to deal with grief and yet find the sweet in one's new life is part and parcel of the setting.
* 'Don't's
    * *Violence:* While there is some violence in the System, and obviously things remain somewhat difficult back phys-side, the core of the conflict should not boil down to or result in wanton violence.
    * *Bigotry:* There are some taboos that remain, such as the one surrounding intraclade relationships (until about 2355), but there is little need to overcome adversity over identity sys-side.
    * *Other characters:* Don't use other characters — even open clades such as the Ode clade — without asking. While many will say yes, this will have the added benefit of you being able to write more closely to the author's vision.
