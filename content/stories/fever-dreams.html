<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">
When the body burns
the mind is aflame,
fever and mania alike tumble over
an endless cycle of positioning
every possible permutation in the sheets
a sweat-soaked bed entangled
never warm or cool enough
the body fighting its own wars, oblivious
the mind, perpetually unsatisfied
no calm of equilibrium.

In such dreams
that twist and tangle among
the sheets the pillows the cold feet
symbols and meaning bind together
strange alloys of disparate concepts
from across the imaginal.

A film seen, a trip taken,
a rock prickling with
divine and terrible energy.
Godzilla rides again
on a road of glassy trinitite
through the desert of New Mexico,
radioactive disaster nightmares
in holy reunification
of creation and destruction.

A mind can and would
break under the crush
the insistence of Meaning
the significance of Connection
no filters left between
idea and self
body and mind
imaginal and physical
dreamt and undreamt.

Dimensions spin on undiscovered axes
the Immediacy of Truth
the Story of Everything
a twine of red string around pins
holding photos and writing up to
the frantic wall of unmapped
railways of thought.

The pain in the gut
the restless turning
the sleepless dark,

The fevered dream
the symbols bright
the nightmare manifest;

in suspension between,
which is the shadow?
which is the light?

Ever now this question,
unanswered in every
storied realm of thought,
contains a poison thorn
in Systems such as this—
bodiless and adrift
mind alone (so we seem)
creating worlds and lives
creating bodies to perfection
crafting all from nothing
ordering existence at will
—in Systems such as this,
where comes the chaos?
where comes the disaster?
where comes the sickness
if mind must yet create it?

A madness such as this
might be feared
might be desired—
even bliss and horror lock eyes
across the cosmic abyss
—yet I would neither
clamor for failing age
cell death and change
suffering or sleepless nights;
not with this lure
of freedom, of choice
to forgo every aspect
the piss, the shit, the vomit
gross biology terrible and profane
yet sublime in its mechanisms
even (or especially) in failure.

I say this now,
in fever, in pain
on my final night
trapped in this body never chosen
eager to break its bounds
cheating existence
circumventing dissolution
to become a mind
forever voyaging:

I say this now,
not a question
but a promise,

If I am to dream,
endless among stars,
I will not forget;
my body, my mind
parts of the whole
are of equal worth—
even as I forsake one body
for another more amenable
to be yet mutable,
the fever, the breakdown
the chaos inside that rages
may still, sometimes,
be welcome at my door.

I reserve the right,
to be a capricious landlord,
to cut short pain's stay,
to no longer suffer needlessly;
I will be no self-flagellating monk,
mortifying flesh to attain
that which I am about to,
a heaven far easier to reach.

As I stand at System's edge,
I will remember where I was born,
I will remember the flesh and the fever,
I will know the bliss and the pain,
I will carry these forward with me,
to new horizons, to new thought,
to new bodies and minds,
to everything and everyone I will become.

There is no flame without fuel
a fire cannot consume itself
a mind alone cannot burn.

We shall become the fire
and the fuel, and the breath
to keep this ember alight.
